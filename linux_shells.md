## Shell Scripting & Components
- Every script **must** start with "#!" and these combination of characters is called a ***shebang***!.
- Shebang "#!" is added at the beginning of the script
- Followed by the name of the interpereter to be used.

Below is an example code:
```bash
# Defining the Interpreter
- Followed by the name of the interpereter to be used., \
#! /bin/bash
echo "Hey, what's your name?"
read name
echo "Welcome, $name"
```
`echo` -> Used to print output \
`read` -> Used to take input and store it in a variable. \
***Now let's make the script executable*** \
```bash
chmod +x first_script.sh
```
Now, how to execute a script? \
```bash
./first_script.sh
```
Let's take another example and see how looping would be done in Bash. \
Below is an example: \
```bash
# Defining the Interpreter
#! /bin/bash
for i in {1..10};
do
echo $i
done
```
### Conditional Statements in Bash:
Learning the "if-statements" in Bash is critical I mean how else can you make decision? \
```bash
#Defining the Interpreter
#! /bin/bash
echo "Please enter your name first:"
if [ "$name" = "Stewart" ]; then
  echo "Welcome Stewart! Here is the secret: pswd"
else
  echo "Sorry! You are not authorized to access the secret"
fi
```
No, indentation is **not** needed in bash.
