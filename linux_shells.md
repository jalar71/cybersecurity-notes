## Shell Scripting & Components
- Every script **must** start with "#!" and these combination of characters is called a ***shebang***!.
- Shebang "#!" is added at the beginning of the script
- Followed by the name of the interpereter to be used.

Below is an example code:
```bash
# Defining the Interpreter
#! /bin/bash
echo "Hey, what's your name?"
read name
echo "Welcome, $name"
```
`echo` -> Used to print output \
`read` -> Used to take input and store it in a variable.
